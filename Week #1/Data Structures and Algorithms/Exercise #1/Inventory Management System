Inventory Management System

Scenario:
You are developing an inventory management system for a warehouse. Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial

o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
-> Data Structures are essential in handling of large inventories as they allow storage and retrieval of data efficiently.
-> Large inventories can be easily handled efficiently using data structures.

o	Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
-> HashMap is a suitable data structure for this problem as it allows storage of data in a key - value pair.
-> The product id will be the key which will have a list of details of product in value.
-> It will efficient storage and access of elements.

o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
-> We are using a HashMap to implement the problem, so the time complexity is O(1) for each operation (add,update,delete).

o	Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
-> Secondary indexing can be used for faster searches on non-primary keys.
