E-commerce Platform Search Function

Scenario:
You are working on the search functionality of an e-commerce platform. The search needs to be optimized for fast performance.

o	Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
-> Big O notation gives us the worst case in time and space complexity of an algorithm.
-> It gives the upper bound of the algorithm.

o	Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
-> Linear Search:
  ~ Best Case : O(1) : First element is the target.
  ~ Average Case : O(n) : Middle element is the target.
  ~ Worst Case : O(n) : Last element is the target or the element is not present.

-> Binary Search:
  ~ Best Case : O(1) : Middle element is the target.
  ~ Average Case : O(log n) : Target is in the middle somewhere.
  ~ Worst Case L O(log n) : Target is the last element.

o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
-> Linear Search : O(n) time complexity
-> Binary Search : O(log n) time complexity

o	Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
-> For my platform till the database is small or unsorted Linear Search is suitable otherwise Binary Search.
