Employee Management System

Scenario:
You are developing an employee management system for a company. Efficiently managing employee records is crucial.

o	Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.
-> Arrays has contiguous memory allocation where each element is stored next to other.
-> Indexing allow access of element with O(1) time.

o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete).
-> Add : O(1)
-> Search : O(n)
-> Traverse : O(n)
-> delete : O(n)

o	Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them.
-> The size is fixed and intialized while making the array, so when the array is full no new elements can be added.
-> Insertion and deletion in middle of array is less efficient.
