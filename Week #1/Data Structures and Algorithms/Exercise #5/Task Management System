Task Management System

Scenario:
You are developing a task management system where tasks need to be added, deleted, and traversed efficiently.

o	Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).
-> Singly Linked List is the linked list where each node only points to the next node.
-> Double Linked List is the linked list where each node points to the next as well as the previous node.

o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation.
-> Add : O(n)
-> Search : O(n)
-> Traverse : O(n)
-> Delete : O(n)

o	Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.
-> Linked lists does not have a fixed size and whenever a new data is to be inserted, make a node of it and then make the last node to point to it.
-> Used for frequent insertion and deletion.
