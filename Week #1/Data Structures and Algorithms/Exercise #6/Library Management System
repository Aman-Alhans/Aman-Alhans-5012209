Library Management System

Scenario:
You are developing a library management system where users can search for books by title or author.

o	Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
-> Linear Search - It searches each element from start till the target element is found.
-> Binary Search - It divides the sorted array from mid and then check the target element. If element is greater than mid, it finds mid of mid + 1 and last element,
    and if mid is smaller than target, then it find mid og mid - 1 and first element.

o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
-> Linear Search : O(n) time complexity
-> Binary Search : O(log n) time complexity.

o	Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.
-> Linear Search is preferred over small and unsorted data, but Binary Search is used for large, sorted data because it has logarithmic complexity.
