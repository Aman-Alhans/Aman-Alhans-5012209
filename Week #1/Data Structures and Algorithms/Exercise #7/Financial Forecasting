Financial Forecasting

Scenario:
You are developing a financial forecasting tool that predicts future values based on past data.

o	Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
-> Recursion is a concept of programming where it solves smaller instances of problem eventually leading to the final solution.
-> Eg. Fibonnaci Series, Factorial of a number etc.

o	Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
-> As n recursive calls are taking place in my algorithm, the time complexity is O(n).

o	Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
-> Recursive solution can be made optimised by storing the result of previous recursive call.

The practical implementaion can be accessed at Exercise #7/FinancialForecasting/src/financial/
