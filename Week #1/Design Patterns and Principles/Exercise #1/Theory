Scenario:
You need to ensure that a logging utility class in your application has only one instance throughout the application lifecycle to ensure consistent logging.

We had to implement the above scenario to show the implementation of Singleton Design Pattern.

-> Singleton Pattern ensures that we only create only one instance of a class and it is only provided global access to.
-> It is very useful when we want a single shared instance of class throught our software.

The practical implementation can be accessed at Excercise#1/SingletonPatternExample/
