-> Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern separates application logic into three components:
  1. The Model ( Data and Business Logic )
  2. The View ( User - Interface )
  3. The Controller ( Handles User Input and Updates Model & View.
-> It promotes separation of concerns and facilitates modular development.
