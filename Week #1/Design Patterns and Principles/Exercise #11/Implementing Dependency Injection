Implementing Dependency Injection

Scenario:
You are developing a customer management application where the service class depends on a repository class. Use Dependency Injection to manage these dependencies.

-> Dependency Injection revolves around a simple process of dependencies being injected through an external source
-> For eg. a company is dependent on employees and the employees are dependent on the company.

The practical implementation can be accessed at: Exercise #11/DependencyInjectionExample/src/dependency/
