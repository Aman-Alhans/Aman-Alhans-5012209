Scenario:
You are developing a document management system that needs to create different types of documents (e.g., Word, PDF, Excel). Use the 
Factory Method Pattern to achieve this.

-> Factory Method Pattern provides an interfacce to create objects and it allows subclasses to decide which class they want to instantiate.
-> It is very useful when we don't want the specify exact class while abstracting creation process and creating objects.

The practical implementation can be accessed at Excercise #2/FactoryMethodPatternExample/bin/
