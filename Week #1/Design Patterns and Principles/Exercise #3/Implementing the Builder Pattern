Implementing the Builder Pattern

Scenario:
You are developing a system to create complex objects such as a Computer with multiple optional parts. Use the Builder Pattern to manage the construction process.

-> Builder Pattern provides a way to construct complex objects step by step.
-> It allows different representation of objects which are created using same contruction process.

The practical implementation can be accessed at: Exercise #3/BuilderPatternExample/src/builder/
