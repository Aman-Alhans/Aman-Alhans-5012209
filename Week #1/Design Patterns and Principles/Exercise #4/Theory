Scenario:
You are developing a payment processing system that needs to integrate with multiple third-party payment gateways with different interfaces. 
Use the Adapter Pattern to achieve this.

-> Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interface to work together by wrapping their classes together.
-> It acts as a bridge between two interfaces.

The practical implementation can be accessed at: Exercise #4/AdapterPatternExample/bin/adapter/
