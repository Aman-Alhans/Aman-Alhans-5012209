Implementing the Decorator Pattern

Scenario:
You are developing a notification system where notifications can be sent via multiple channels (e.g., Email, SMS). 
Use the Decorator Pattern to add functionalities dynamically.

-> Decorator Pattern allows adding new behaviour and functions to an object dynamically by wrapping it with on or more decorator objects.
-> It provides an alternate way to subclasses for extending functionalty for object at runtime.

The practical implementation can be accessed at: Exercise #5/DecoratorPatternExample/src/noti/
