Implementing the Proxy Pattern

Scenario:
You are developing an image viewer application that loads images from a remote server. Use the Proxy Pattern to add lazy initialization and caching.

-> Proxy Pattern provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it.
-> It is useful when we want to add an extra layer of control over access of an object.

The practical implementation can be accessed at: Exercise #6/ProxyPatternExample/src/proxy/
