Implementing the Observer Pattern

Scenario:

Use the Observer Pattern to achieve this.

-> Observer Pattern has a one to many relation between objects so that one object changes its state, it dependencies are notified and updated.
-> It is commonly used it Event Handling System, User Interface updates and in Mobile/Web development.
