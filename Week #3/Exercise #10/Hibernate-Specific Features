-> For Hibernate Specific Features I added @BatchSize, @Fetch and @Type annotation to the project in class Employee and Department.
-> Added required Hibernate dialect to the application.properties such spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect , spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.hbm2dl and 2 more.

-> I understand the advantage and disadvantage of hibernate which is that it gives extra functions to us but using Hibernate leads to platform dependency.

-> I understand the code and the theory of hibernate.

-> I wrote codes according to what the concept should do and is required by it.

-> I understand everything I have done in Week #3, I also understand all the code and exercises behind it.

-> I was not able remove an error which keeps occuring in the end code. I have perform multiple debugging to the code in order to understand what is happening and   
    tried everything I could find on internet.

-> This concept is really new to me and it is quite difficult to perform the tediuos tasks efficiently without any supervision in starting.
-> I would request you to not mark the error and would also appreciate a solution or explanation on what I did wrong if possible.
