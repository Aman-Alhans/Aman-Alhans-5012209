In this to define queries I used @Query annotation to define the method findByEmployeeName in EmployeeRepository  with @Param in same and used @NamedQuery 
annotation in entity Employee class to define the method findByDepartmentId with @Param in EmployeeRepository.

Also, I could have define @Query for both methods in EmployeeRepository or use @NamedQueries to define both methods in entity Employee class.
