For this exercise Added Auding annotation to the project.

-> Firstly, used @EnableJpaAuditing in the class where Main function is located.
-> Secondly, used @EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class) on top of both Employee and Department classes.
-> Thirdly, created field such as createdBy, lastModifiedBy, createdDate, lastModifiedDate in both Employee and Department classes and added
   @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy, @CreatedDate, @LastModifiedDate annotation respectively to the fields.
-> I added @Getter and @Setter annotation using Lombok to both Employee and Department to avoid using unnecessary boilerplate code,
   but i did'nt delete the Setter and Getter functions I created before just so that I can remember both of them.
