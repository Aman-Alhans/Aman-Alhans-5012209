In this exercise:

Created two separate classes for primary and secondary data configuration and did necessary changes.

I understand the usage and theory, plus I know how to implement it.

An error kept occuring and even with continuous debugging and searching youtube and google I was not able to solve it.
I tried everything I could find on the google and came with this solution/code.

Please help if know the issue that is occuring if possible.

Also if possible please don't mark it as wrong as it is really difficult to learn these concepts virtually using text based data and youtube.
