-> Created com.example.bookstoreapi.dto package which contained BookDTO and CustomerDTO classes.

-> Then added Mapstruct and mapstruct-processor dependencies in pom.xml file.

-> Created com.example.bookstoreapi.mapper package which contained BookMapper and CustomerMapper Interfaces having custome abstract classes of toDTO and toEntity.

-> Added Customer Serialization and deserialization to BookDTO and CustomerDTO classes using @JsonPropert and @JsonFormat annotations.

-> Updated BookController and CustomerController with DTOs and Mappers.

-> As the code was not able to get Bean for BookMapper and CustomerMapper interface, I manually created Bean for them in class MapperConfig.
